This is the Beta version of the FENGSHA dust emission model from the CMAQ model, with modifications made
by Mallia et al. 2017. The code consistists of two python scripts, where the master script does the general
model calculations (FENGSHA_dust_emission_model.py), while another piece of Python code 
(FENGSHA_dust_emission_model.py) consists of a number of functions that carry out the more tedious 
programming tasks like regridding. 

A more comprehensive write up will be provided later on.
